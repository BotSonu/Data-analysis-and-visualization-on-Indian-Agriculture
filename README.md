### Data Analysis and Visualization on Indian Agriculture ðŸŒ¾ðŸ“Š  

This project combines data analysis and visualization techniques to explore the complexities of Indian agriculture. By leveraging **Python** for visualization and **R Studio** for statistical analysis, it uncovers key insights into crop production, regional trends, and other agricultural factors.  

#### Key Highlights:  
- **Data Cleaning**: Transforming raw data into a structured format for analysis.  
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Using **R** (in **R Studio**) to calculate measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and summarize data.  
- **Meta-Analysis**: Performing meta-analysis with **metabin** in **R Studio** to integrate findings across various agricultural studies.  
- **Visualization**: Employing Python (via **Jupyter Notebooks**) for generating visualizations and comparative analysis.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Analyzing data to highlight trends, disparities, and key insights in the agricultural sector.  

#### Tech Stack:  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (for visualization)  
- **R** (via **R Studio**): metabin, descriptive statistics, and data preprocessing  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive exploration and visualizations  
- **Datasets**: Publicly available datasets on Indian agriculture
